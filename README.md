# SAS-macro-verify-cox-assumptions
Cox proportional hazards models are often used to analyze survival data in clinical research. This article describes a macro that makes producing the correct diagnostics for Cox proportional hazards models fast and easy. The macro has three advantages over performing all the diagnostics one by one. First, it makes it easy to run diagnostics for a long list of similar models. Second, it allows the specification of the variables for which diagnostics should be run. Third, it produces a comprehensive list of plots and tables necessary for evaluation of the Cox proportional hazards model assumptions as recommended in the SAS® course “Survival Analysis Using the Proportional Hazards Model.” This macro can help save hours of code-writing time for a programmer who performs survival analysis.
